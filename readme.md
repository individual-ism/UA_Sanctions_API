#### Description
In light of the invasion by Russia on the 24th of February 2022, it is imperative that information be propagated regarding the entities - both individuals and enterprises - which undermine the struggle for freedom. Although some may be compelled to dismiss the war as a "far away" conflict - not warranting the attention of those whose lives are far removed from it - this is the mentality which allowed both world wars to become the abominations they were. The ultimate conclusion of this war has definitive implications and explications on the world entire.
